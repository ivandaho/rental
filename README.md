# rental
AngularJS based webapp for renting video equipment for a University Mass Communications department

A demo can be viewed at [http://ivandaho.github.io/rental](http://ivandaho.github.io/rental)

Similar to a web store:



Since each item is unique, there will be individual entries for each item
(there might be multiples of the same product, but each item will have its own id).<br>
Users should be able to toggle their desired selection with mouse clicks, then proceed to check out.<br>
Eventually the check out process should send something to a server that notifies an admin of the rental request.<br>
The goal is to make this readable and functional on mobile devices as well as desktop computers. <br>

UPDATE: After discussion with a faculty member for implementation of this webapp, I am awaiting further information regarding the gear before progressing.

There will be approximately 4 base kits up for selection, with their components included in each kit. Additional items not included in the kits can be obtained as well.

#### To do:
* Get full inventory<br>
* ~~Display availability of item (greyed out and unclickable if unavailable)~~<br>
* ~~Display different categories (camera, mic, tripod, etc), perhaps by color, or other useful stats~~<br>
* Sort by: availability, category, rating, condition<br>
* Accurate pictures of item<br>
* Detailed description page with specifications or special notes<br>
* Limit number of items that a single user can request<br>
* Cart/checkout page<br>
* Actual method to send data to admin<br>
* Improve layout design<br>
* FAQ or about page<br>
* Instructions
