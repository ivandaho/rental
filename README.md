# rental
AngularJS based webapp for renting video equipment

Similar to a web store

Since each item is unique, there will be individual entries for each item
(there might be multiples of the same product, but each item will have its own id).<br>
Users should be able to toggle their desired selection with mouse clicks, then proceed to check out.<br>
Eventually the check out process should send something to a server that notifies an admin of the rental request.<br>
The goal is to make this readable and functional on mobile devices as well as desktop computers. <br>

<br>
#### To do:
* Get full inventory<br>
* Display availability of item (greyed out and unclickable if unavailable)<br>
* Display different categories (camera, mic, tripod, etc), perhaps by color, or other useful stats<br>
* Sort by: availability, category, rating, condition<br>
* Accurate pictures of item<br>
* Detailed description page with specifications or special notes<br>
* Limit number of items that a single user can request<br>
* Cart/checkout page<br>
* Actual method to send data to admin<br>
* Improve layout design<br>
* FAQ or about page<br>
